# Static Path
  + Used to match the exact incoming request
  + e.g
    GET   /clients/all          controllers.Clients.list() 
    
# Dynamic Path (Exactly one **`URI path segment`(ie one /) using :)
  + Example 
    - Can be used to retieve a client by ID
    GET   /clients/:id          controllers.Clients.show(id: Long)
    
# Dynamic Path spanning several `/`
  + * also called Wild Card pattern
  + Example
    GET   /files/*name          controllers.Application.download(name)
  + *** Note
    - Dynamic parts spanning '/' are not decoded by router or encoded by reverse router. read more..???

  + Defined using $id<regex> syntax
  + Example
    GET   /items/$id<[0-9]+>    controllers.Items.show(id: Long)
